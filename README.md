# Structure and Intepretation of Computer Programs
I've been asked to be an accountability partner to work through the text Structure and Intepretation of Computer Programs (commonly known as SICP).
I am writing this README only after working through 40% of the book, in case I give up and bail out early. 
This repo contains the exercise files written in Scheme. I adopt the following conventions.
- Each file is named accordingly to the section of the book (i.e 2_5_3.scm for section 2.5.3). 
- Comments are used to indicate each exercise (i.e ; ex 2.94 for exercise 2.94).

## Running the code
I write and run the code using DrRacket IDE from [Racket Website](https://racket-lang.org/). 
Specifically, I use the [SICP package](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/) for working through the exercises.

## Disclaimer
I am using these files to chart progress, and make no guarantee of correctness of any of the solutions here.
